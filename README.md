Movie Sales Analysis using Power BI
This project analyzes movie sales data using Power BI to uncover trends in revenue, ratings, genres, and audience engagement. Interactive dashboards were built to help stakeholders identify top-performing movies, genres, and directors and support data-driven decisions in the movie industry.

## Key Insights
1. Movie releases increased steadily from 2006 to peak years, showing clear growth patterns in the industry.
2. A small set of genres contributes the majority of total revenue, making genre selection critical for profitability.
3. High IMDb ratings alone do not guarantee high revenue, but movies with strong ratings and high vote counts perform better.
4. Certain directors consistently generate higher box-office revenue, indicating director influence on commercial success.
5. Optimal runtime ranges are associated with higher average revenue compared to very short or very long movies.
6. Audience engagement measured through votes strongly correlates with movie popularity and revenue.
7. Year-wise revenue trends reveal periods of high performance that can guide release timing strategies.
8. Genre-wise trends over time show shifting audience preferences rather than a single dominant genre.
